MyPaint 0.9.0 beta1 has now been released. This release has most of the
new features, changes and fixes that will be in MyPaint 0.9.0. A list of
the improvements is unfortunately not available at this time, so just
check it out instead ;)  
The final relase will be out in between 2 and 4 weeks time.

Here is the source code:
<http://download.gna.org/mypaint/mypaint-0.9.0-beta1.tar.bz2>  
And the windows installer:
<http://download.gna.org/mypaint/mypaint-0.9.0-beta1-win32-installer.exe>  
Please test and report any issues.

We are now in string freeze for MyPaint 0.9.0, which means that it is
time to do translations. We could always need more help with this,
especially for supporting new languages. In addition we are in need of
people who would like to write documentation.  
If you want to help out, please
[get in touch with us](http://mypaint.intilinux.com/?page_id=14).

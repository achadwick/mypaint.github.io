The latest binary release can always be found
on our [Github releases page][gh-rels].

The Github page linked above
is the only completely official download location.
Please do not use random third party download sites
not mentioned on this page.

* **Linux**: we make semi-regular [Ubuntu PPA releases][ubuntu-rels]
  during the development cycle.
  These will get you the latest bleeding edge of development.

* **Linux**: many major OS distributions include
  the most recent stable MyPaint package.

* **Mac OS X**: MyPaint is available in MacPorts.
  Please offer your assistance on Github
  if you want to help make it available through other channels,
  and are willing to spend some time diagnosing
  and fixing porting issues.

* **Windows**: as of 1.2.0-beta.0,
  we’re offering [official Win32 and Win64 binary installers][gh-rels]
  from Github for your testing.
  I’m taking great pains to make sure that the new builds derive
  from known signed sources,
  and that the build is documented well enough
  to be replicated by anyone.
  The most recent binaries are signed with PGP,
  using the same key as the PPA.

* **Windows**: long-time MyPaint porter TumaGonx has an
  [experimental MyPaint build for Windows available from their blog](tuma-rels).
  This may be more thoroughly tested than our newer releases,
  and you are welcome to try both and compare the results!

Please note that 1.0.0 is a very old release,
and is no longer supported on any platform.
Version 1.1.0 is the latest stable release,
but as we approach the 1.2.0 stable release
our support for it is increasingly limited
(you may be asked to try one of the more recent betas if you ask
for support on it in our issues tracker!)
